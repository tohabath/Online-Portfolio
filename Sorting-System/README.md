# Overview

In this project, I made a light task-list system; items can be added, completed, and removed. It also includes a point systems, so completion of tasks can be scored!

I wanted to take the opportunity to become better acquainted with Javascript and its moderately unique syntax, so I thought this program would be a wonderful starting point.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode for scripting, made files for a stylesheet, html, and js, and used Javascript for coding.

# Future Work

- The deletion system doesn't always delete the right thing
- I should update the array used for listing items
- The webpage used to present the system could look better
