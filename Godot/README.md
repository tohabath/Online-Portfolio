# Overview

For this project, I made a simple text adventure in Godot. The player writes what they want to do in an input field at the bottom of the screen, and the story plays out accordingly. Available commands are indicated by hovering the cursor over underlined words. When “traveling”, a little cutscene plays of the player character going from one place to the next.

# Development Environment

Here are the resources I used to make the game:
* Godot (to create the game)
* Krita (for artwork)
* Inkscape (to create the icon)
* Musescore (for music and sounds)
* Obsidian MD (for planning)
