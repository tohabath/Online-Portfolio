# Overview

Here, I chose to create a text adventure. The player makes decisions that affect four resources. Run out of one, and it's game over!

Features included in this experience are a small animation, a dynamic story that changes based on choices, and outcomes that are influenced by player resources but ultimately randomized.

I always love the opportunity to use technology to allow people to interact with stories immersively, rather than have them experience it strictly vicariously. My purpose in writing this program was to challenge myself to create a simple yet enjoyable game in a single stretch.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode, along with the available/essential C# extensions, and coded the program in C#.

# Future Work

- The program doesn't account for situations where players misinput. 
- Originally, this was going to include difficulty settings as a feature, but is not fully implemented yet.
- The classes are not smartly organized; some are unnecessarily big, while others are small enough to be consolidated. This should be revised.
