# Overview

For this project, I made a game of Hangman in Kotlin. I understand Kotlin holds a lot of application in the development of Android applications, which is what sparked my interest in creating a program with it.

The program selects a word, generates "blanks" for the word ("_"), then in a loop has the player guess letters. Correct guesses replace the blanks with their corresponding letters, incorrect guesses cause parts of the "hangman" to be printed (head, neck, shoulders, torso, legs). The player can only get five letters wrong before it's game over.

# Development Environment

To create this program, I used the text editing application IntelliJ IDEA, Community Edition, and created a Kotlin project with its tools.

# Future Work

- Add a feature allowing the player to play again.
- Add a feature to customize the general length of the secret word.
- Update Hangman visual to better resemble a man being hanged.
