# Overview

I love the satisfaction of solving problems and exercising creativity in programming. While software will be simple starting out, expect this repository to be populated with all kinds of projects soon!

My first piece of software to show is a classic; a hello world program.

For Hello World, I installed Python and created the program in VSCode.
